# Chameleon Mod

Chameleon Mod is a mod for Among Us that adds a new role in Among Us, the chameleon. The chameleon has the possibility to become invisible for a certain period of time. He is part of the crewmates and can use his ability to find impostors more easily.

## FAQ

### How can I remove or disable the mod?

Delete or remove the next file from the folder: `Steam\steamapps\common\Among Us\BepInEx\plugins\ChameleonMod.dll`

### Can we play on official servers with this mod?

Currently there are no checks on the Innersloth servers, so you can play privately with your friends on the official servers. **Please do not use it in public online matches.**\
In case Innersloth implements server-side checks, I recommend that you take a look at private servers like [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor).

### Does everyone have to install the mod in the lobby?

Yes everyone has to install it.

### Can we play with crewlink?

Yes.
